# Customer-Churn
# Introduction
- This repository contains a Python implementation of customer churn prediction using various machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. The goal is to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on their attributes.

# Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

#  Code Explanation


- Load data: Load the dataset from the specified file.
- Preprocess data: Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train models: Train the Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests models using the training data.
- Evaluate models: Evaluate the models on the testing data using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Compare models: Compare the performance of the different models and select the best one based on the chosen evaluation metrics.
